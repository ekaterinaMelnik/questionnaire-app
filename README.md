# React Boilerplate

Features:

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
- [SASS (scss syntax)](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [CSS - modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)

## CLI commands

- `npm run dev` - run development server with HMR and watch all changes (log of webpack is minimized)
- Now you can open the app in your browser via [url](http://localhost:8000/)
- `npm run build` - build and minify all files for production (create `build` folder)

## Coding agreement

Lets start using editorconfig and eslint for this project. This help us to have one code style for the whole project. All code styles rules should be specified in `/.eslintrc`.

## Code formatting and linting

- ### Used next libraries:

  - [Eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) - resolves all **Code Equality** rules(for example `no-unused-vars`)

## New features(if you add new aliases)

IDE and editors should be restarted to be able to resolve new aliases
